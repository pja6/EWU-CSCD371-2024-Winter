     * Inside of BaseLoggerMixins implement extension methods on BaseLogger for
       Error, ❌✔
       Warning, ❌✔
       Information, and ❌✔
       Debug. ❌✔ Each of these methods should take in a string for the message, as well as a parameter array 
       of arguments for the message. Each of these extension methods is expected to be a shortcut for calling 
       the BaseLogger.Log method, by automatically supplying the appropriate LogLevel. These methods should 
       throw an exception if the BaseLogger parameter is null. There are a couple example unit tests to get 
       you started.
